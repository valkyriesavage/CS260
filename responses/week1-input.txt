Many everyday input devices are lacking in usability; by framing these usability problems in the context of models spanning from descriptive to predictive, we can attempt to correct them.  One such usability improvement is the bubble mouse, which improves user performance on target acquisition tasks by dynamic modification of its size and/or shape (and thereby maximization of the effective width of targets) in a predictable way.

The textbook contributes to my understanding, I suppose, a novel intellectual framework, in that it’s really laying the groundwork for the presentation of the other paper.  It has neatly tied a fairly long history of research in the area of input mechanisms into a tidy little chapter.

I like the idea of a continuum of models ranging from descriptive to predictive; it fits neatly into my mental model of how other fields somewhat within my experience seem to work (linguists range along a scale from descriptive to prescriptive, psychologists are on a multi-dimensional grid ranging from nature to nurture, developmental to evolutionary, etc.).  However, I was vaguely disappointed that despite the fact that it was touted as a continuum, no example was given that seemed to be solidly situated between the two.

The right-handed vs. left-handed question of keyboard and mouse use has come up fairly often in my own life, living as I do with as many left-handed people as right-handed people.  I suppose we've all considered the problems with keyboards before, and it was interesting to read a formal discourse on them.  The poor interactions for righties between keyboards and mice is one of the reasons I stick to using text editors like vim that don't require mouse manipulation.  Someday I’ll teach myself dvorak... in the meantime, I'm actually more interested in their discussion of mice and how they aren't "true 2D devices".  That was sort of a new idea for me; I’d never really paused to apply actual mathematical insight to the basic interaction of myself and my mouse (well, now touchpad).  Although the paper cited by the textbook seemed to mainly extol the values of such a thing in the context of e.g. photo manipulation and drawing programs, I can't help but imagine its contributions to games: e.g. computer pool, ping pong, or air hockey.

The bubble cursor concept seemed interesting, too, and perhaps useful.  The value in studying this area of interaction is a great one; as target acquisition is such a common task, improvements can make a huge impact.  The bubble cursor being obviously a natural extension of the prior work mentioned about area cursors, its ideas are certainly improvements over that earlier work.  The change from a square cursor to a round one seems like a natural choice, but the decision to have a dynamically resizing interaction tool is strikingly novel.  “Hit boxes” for all kinds of targets, from icons on the desktop to bad guys in a video game, have long frustrated me as a user.  And while enlarging a Goomba’s hit box based on Mario’s location seems unfair, if my computer can, in some sense, “predict” or “understand” what I’m trying to click on or navigate to in my new, free copy of CS5, my life gets easier.  (I wonder what sorts of interactions would pop out of applying dynamic target acquisition and a true 2D mouse.)

I wonder about a couple things related to that study: first, how many of the participants in the study consider themselves "power users" (for some definition of "power user") versus "casual users"?  I think I would find my mouse behaving in such a way to be rather disorienting, at the very least until a cap was instituted on how large the targeting circle could be, which, happily, they discuss in the future work section.  It certainly sounds like the bubble cursor adheres more closely to the principle of least surprise than the area cursor, but I suppose I'm curious to implement it and see if I could actually live with such a thing.  I do consider myself a 'power user', and its given behavior seems, while easily predictable, quite odd.  Second, I wondered at the fact that there were no left-handed participants in either the 1D study or the 2D study.  Was it intentional?  Maybe they just have a left-handed mouse on hand?  I doubt it would make much of a difference, given that the targets alternated sides of the screen, but I'm curious.  (Cue Valkyrie Googling about hemispheric and ocular dominance; she returns with the result that, since vision is controlled more or less equally by both hemispheres, Right Shift Theory, which indicates different strengths in processing that are correlated to handedness, is sadly irrelevant.)
